## 🧠 Overview

The **Job Application Tracker** is a simple, user-focused web application designed to help job seekers **organize, track, and manage their job applications efficiently**.

Instead of relying on spreadsheets or scattered notes, this tool provides a **centralized and structured view** of applications, making it easier to monitor progress and follow up at the right time.

## 🎯 Problem

When applying to multiple jobs across platforms, candidates often struggle to:
- Remember where they have applied  
- Track application status updates  
- Manage interviews and follow-ups  

This lack of visibility can lead to missed opportunities and poor organization.

## 💡 Solution

This application solves the problem by allowing users to:
- Add job applications with essential details  
- Track the current status of each application  
- View all applications in one clean interface  

The design prioritizes **simplicity, clarity, and ease of use**, making it suitable for everyday job-search workflows.
