## 📌 Overview

The **Job Application Tracker** is a practical web application built to help job seekers **organize and track their job applications efficiently**.

Instead of managing applications through spreadsheets or scattered notes, this tool provides a **centralized, structured view** of all applications and their current status.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Job seekers often apply to multiple roles across different platforms, which makes it difficult to:
- Track where they have applied  
- Monitor application statuses  
- Manage follow-ups and interviews  

This lack of organization can lead to missed opportunities.

## 💡 Solution

This application allows users to:
